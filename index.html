            Some things I enjoy doing are playng games, going on adventures, and the color green. I enjoy new adventures because it keeps my mind busy and not bored. I tend to get bored really easily and don't enjoy spending my days away on the internet because it is sad. But during the night, I play games because that's the best time to meet crazy people on COD.</p>

        <h2>Where Do Is Samantha Her From?</h2>
        <p>I am Hmong. Hmong has a long history of going from one place to another and we do not currently have a country of our own- but we do still manage to get together when times call for it. A couple generations back, my grandma and grandpa, used to live in Loas and Thailand. When the Vietnam war hit, we sided with the United States because we did not want the spread of communism. Unfortunately we lost- but we were granted a pass to America and here I am, the first American born Hmong generation. </p>
